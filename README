This is a calculator project from an FPGA class I took in Fall 2015 at Indiana University.
A description of what it does is in the header of "main.v"
This project was from near the end of the semester, and represents most of what we learned to do in the course.

"main.xdc" specifies the internal connections of the FPGA and is of little interest. 
"main.v" contains the actual code.
"bin2seg.v" is a supplementary module that I wrote.

I wrote 100% of the code in this project.
