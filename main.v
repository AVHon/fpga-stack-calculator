// Stack-based calculator for FPGA, controlled by serial connection (SPI).
// November 18, 2015
// Alex Von Hoene
//
// This is a simple, stack-based calculator. Any usb-based microcontroller (we used a cheap STM board)
// can be used to interact with and use the calculator from a computer. A serial (SPI) bus communicates
// commands, arguments, and responses to and from the FPGA. Four 7-segment displays on the FPGA board show
// the last received command and the last message send back from the FPGA.
//
// Commands are 1 byte, and are always followed by a second byte. If the commands requires sending a number to
// the FPGA (for example, "push"), that number is in the second byte. An additional 8 clocks are sent by the STM
// after the second byte, during which the FPGA sends its response.
//
// = How the display is draw to; and why are there two clocks? =
//Â The FPGA board we are using has four 7-segment displays, and a bus that can only write 7 segments at once.
// There are also 4 additional bits, which enable or disable each display. To write unique contents to eac
// display, you need to turn all but one display off, write the contents of the one remaining display, wait a
// few dozen milliseconds, then turn that display off and move to the next one. If you switch quickly enough,
// each display will seem to be steadily and brightly showing its own content. The "clk" input is used to provide
// the timely signal for switching between displays. The serial clock from the STM board is only used when commands
// are being sent.
